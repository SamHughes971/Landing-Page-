# Landing Page

15/04/2024 - I feel like I have completed this project to the best of my abilities. This project enabled me to improve my programming skills and become more familiar with website design. Additionally, this project allowed me to broaden my understanding by researching concepts and finally implementing those concepts into something practical. Finally, this project made me appreciate the importance of Git (and GitHub) even more, and doing so enabled me to improve my frequency of commits and add more concise commit messages. 

However, there are quite a few parts I can improve on such as; understanding how to optimally use Flexbox, remembering to use DevTools when appropriate to diagnose problems more efficiently, and complying with best coding practices like indentation and class names.

In conclusion, this project has made me feel like I have learned so much already in terms of research and programming ability and it has kept me motivated. Further to this, I have learned to embrace making mistakes as it is part of the process to learn how to rectify these mistakes and to constantly improve.
